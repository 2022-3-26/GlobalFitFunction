# GlobalFitFunction
The experimental data was globally fitted in the OriginPro 2021 software package, using the script GlobalFitFunction.FDF.In the global fitting practice in OriginPro, the parameter \varphi_1 should be shared among scatted curves in Figure 2a-c, and the parameter \varphi_2 should be shared among scatted curves in Figure 2d-f, components of \chi_{ij}^{(2)} should be shared in all the six curves. To achieve the above goal, the six additional parameters, s_1, s_2, s_3, k_1, k_2, and k_3 were introduced in the fitting script, which acted as the ON/OFF controller of the corresponding fitting functions, and therefore, we can fit six curves in one expression (the expression indeed includes six fitting functions controlled by s or k controller).
